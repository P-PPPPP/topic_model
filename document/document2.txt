Sam is a little fish. He lives in the sea. He is very lonely. He wants to have a friend. The friend looks like him. Sam sees an ink fish. The ink fish has eight legs. He doesn’t look like Sam. So Sam goes away.
Sam meets a shark. He wants to say hello to the shark. The shark opens his big mouth. Sam runs away quickly.
Sam is tired and hungry. He wants to have a rest. Then he sees a round fish. She says to him. “Hello! Would you like to be my friend?”
Sam answers: “Of course! But you are round. I am flat.” The round fish days: “But we are both fishes.”
Sam thinks and says, “You are right. Let’s be friends.” They become good friends.
