Hi, welcome to Faith Radio Online-Simply to Relax, I’m Faith. I realized a few years ago why we all need to climb a mountain every now and then. When we climb mountains, face challenges, hurdle1 obstacles and learn from difficult situations we remind ourselves that we have the strength, power and energy to overcome lifes challenges. At first even a little mountain may seem like a big insurmountable mountain. But when you step back and climb it you realize, "I can do this."
You realize within you is a source of strength, power and energy that you didnt know you had. After all, the mountain, no matter how big it is, is no match for your focused energy and desire to climb it. Mountains are meant to be climbed. Wounds are meant to be healed and problems are meant to become learning experiences. They all serve a purpose. They make us stronger mentally, emotionally and spiritually. So, here we are, in front of us is that mountain, don’t hesitate, just go ahead and climb it, climb that mountain.
